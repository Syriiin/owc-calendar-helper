# owc-calendar-helper

This is a quick and dirty script to generate an [iCalendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) file for OWC match schedules.

Find the generated .ics files below for direct import into your calendar app of choice (google calendar, etc...) 

Note the calendars may be updated throughout the week as matches are rescheduled. Usually I wait until Friday to import the matches to my calendar, in case of late reschedules.
